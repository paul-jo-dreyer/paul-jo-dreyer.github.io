It's kind of a wild story how this project came about. In January 2020, I seperated from active duty in the Air Force, and I had been saving up some money for a few years to do a huge backpacking trip across several continents. This trip was supposed to last around 18 months, and being such a long duration I treated it a little different than most vacations or shorter trips. I knew I wanted to go to school for engineering, and I wanted to make sure I was preparing for that transition when the trip was over. So every day, I would practice designing things in CAD, I would learn some math etc., and then I would go out and do the daily adventures and see the sights. I was itching to start a project that would push my skills a bit, and I had always been fascinated with the mechanics of the human hand, so I decided to embark on designing a low cost prosthetic arm. This started out as just a side project to do for fun, but it turned into something way cooler one day in Colombia. 

I had been staying in Medellin for a few weeks, and one night I decided to go to a new language exchange. While I was hanging out there, I noticed a 3D printed prosthetic arm in a donation box in the corner of the cafe. I recognized the design from the company Enable, which is based in Seattle, from some background research looking into 3D printing for prostehtics at the time. It turns out there was a branch organization of Enable called Humanos3D based in the flat above this cafe of all places. I wandered upstairs and ended up meeting the team working there, I showed them some of my preliminary designs, and they ended up letting me develop the prototype on their 3D printers while I was staying in the city - unbelievably rad of these guys.

Over the next few weeks, I printed a few iterations and refined the mechanisms, developed some basic circuits for haptic feedback, and ended up with what's pictured above. Unforunately, Covid has made it's way to Colombia around April of 2020, and I decided to head back to the US, not knowing if the airports/borders would remain open. I donated the IP of the designs to Humanos, but am unsure if the arms ever made their way into small production.
