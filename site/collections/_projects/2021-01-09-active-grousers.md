Near the end of 2020, I had joined the NASA Artemis challenege through my college. The goal for this project was to build a radio controlled rover which would navigate through an obstacle course, and eventually needed to "repair" a hold in a simulated lunar lava tube. The course was partially smooth hard terrain, as well as loose sand, with large obstacles scattered about.

I designed this weel system as a way to improve the robot's ability to navigate all terrain types in the course. The black surfaces on the wheel are actuated "grousers", which are similar to the traction features found on tank treads. On the back side of the wheel, a small DC motor is controlled to rotated the lead screw, which draws in a linkage mechanism. This mechanism allows us to remotely adjust the grouser height from the surface of the wheel, and effectively change the traction surface exposed on the wheel face.
