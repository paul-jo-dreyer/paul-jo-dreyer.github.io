        Personal:
      </h2>
      <p>I love backpacking, mini adventures, and above all else learning new things. I love to share
        the things I'm learning about with others, and I recently started writing blog articles to 
        dive deeper into some of the technical details of my passion projects.

      <h3>Internships</h3>

      <p><strong>Dirac Inc.</strong> (2024) (3mo.)</p>
      <p>Dirac is a startup in NYC building software that automatically generates work instructions
        for manufacturing from uploaded CAD assemblies. During my time at Dirac, I developed a novel
        trajectory optimization algorithm which solves for minimum collision assembly paths for each
        3D geometry in the given problem.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ford Motors</strong> (2023) (3mo.)</p>
      <p>During my time at Ford, I developed an end-to-end synthetic data generation pipeline, which 
        enables users to create labeled synthetic images from CAD models of a given part or assembly.
        This allowed the team to train deep learning models to classify assembly quality of 
        mechanical and electrical components through out the vehicle. This was an early research project,
        and we found that given the manufacturing line is a relatively predicatable environment in
        domain factors (lighting direction, intensity, rigid objects), we were able to train models
        to classify assembly accuracy with a less than 2% failure rate when trained from purely synthetic
        images, deployed zero-shot to the real world. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>Bio Robotics Lab - Carnegie Mellon</strong> (2022) (9mo.)</p>
      <p>I participated as a research assistant for several projects in the BioRobo lab. My main
        contribution was for the ARPA-E pipe-in-pipe trenchless repair project. This project was tasked
        with developing a robot which could traverse underground gas pipelines, and make critical 
        repairs to the existing infrastructure - avoiding the need to trench the pipes. To do this,
        I developed a special eliptical nozzle which would extrude a concentric resin pipe within 
        the existing pipe. This nozzle had special rollers at the edge which would automatically
        accound for deformations in the surface of the existing pipe due to rust / debris accumulation. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>Humanos3D</strong> (2020) (1mo.)</p>
      <p>This is kind of a crazy story; In 2020 (before Covid - and before I even started college), 
        I started what was supposed to be a 18 month backpacking trip across several continents. While
        I was travelling, I wanted to continue improving my design skills with a challenging project,
        so I decided to spend some time designing a low cost prosthetic arm for below elbow amputees.
        This sounds random, and indeed it was, but the nature of interfacing with the human body and 
        creating usable grasping mechanisms intrigued me. While I was staying in Medellin, Colombia,
        I stumbled across a donation box with a 3D printed prosthetic arm in it which I recognized
        as a design from Enable3D during some background research. It turned out there was a remote
        chapter of this company working on the floor above me. I met the team on a whim that day,
        and they allowed me to print and further develop my protoype while I was still in the city, which
        they could then reuse in the future.

      <h3>Prior Experience</h3>

      <p><strong>United States Air Force</strong> (2014-2020) (6yr.)</p>
      <p>I enlisted in the USAF after high school, where I worked as a radio RF specialist. My main roles
        in the USAF included maintaining base communication SATCOM hubs at RAF Lakenheath (U.K.), 
        as well as supporting a JTAC unit with long range HF at JBLM (WA).
