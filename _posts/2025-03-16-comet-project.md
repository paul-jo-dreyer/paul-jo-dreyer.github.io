## Background

"Comet" is an open-source project I started in 2024. It is an autonomous assistant robot platform which acts as a brand new way to interface with software in the home / office. It moves around a room it is set up in via [suspension actuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_robots), which means that thin wires suspend the robot in space, and they change length to drive the robot around a room. This results in a robot which appears to hover in place very quietly, can answer questions, show apps / games on it's LCD screen, and deliver a rediculously cool experience

## Key Features / Efforts

<!-- [Getting Started]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2016-10-10-getting-started %}): getting started with installing Millennial, whether you are completely new to using Jekyll, or simply just migrating to a new Jekyll theme. -->

## Design considerations

Comet is born from a dream to have a cost-feasible autonomous robot in the home. To achieve this dream, every decision is built on the basis of:

1. Accesible manufacturing techniques for most DIY makers
2. Widely sourcable component selection
