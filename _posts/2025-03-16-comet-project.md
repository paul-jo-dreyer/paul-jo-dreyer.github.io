## Background

"Comet" is an open-source project I started in 2024. It is an autonomous assistant robot platform which acts as a brand new way to interface with software in the home / office. It moves around a room it is set up in via [suspension actuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_robots), which means that thin wires suspend the robot in space, and they change length to drive the robot around a room. This results in a robot which appears to hover in place very quietly, can answer questions, show apps / games on it's LCD screen, and deliver a rediculously cool experience
